# Building a Data-Driven Dashboard for analysing web traffic 

As a data scientist, I collaborated closely with a web developer to design and implement an e-commerce platform specifically geared towards promoting green businesses. My primary role in this project was to design a comprehensive dashboard capable of monitoring key metrics and measurements over time. This involved defining the data sources and selecting the necessary tools to ensure the platform's effectiveness and success.
In the current market, the demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products is on the rise. This creates a significant opportunity for an e-commerce platform dedicated to green businesses. However, merely offering green products is insufficient. It is crucial to ensure an optimal user experience and achieve high conversion rates for the platform to be truly successful.
By leveraging web traffic data, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior. This enables us to identify areas that need improvement and implement data-driven strategies to enhance user engagement and increase conversions. The plan I developed outlines a comprehensive approach using analytics to build and optimize the e-commerce site for green businesses.
The culmination of my part of the project was a sophisticated dashboard developed using Dash, a framework for building analytical web applications. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing key metrics related to web traffic and customer behavior on our e-commerce platform in real time, dedicated to green businesses. In this post, I will present one of the initial prototypes of the dashboard. While this prototype may lack polished styling compared to the final producto and design elements, its primary goal is to demonstrate the functionality and integration of web traffic metrics essential for monitoring and understanding customer behavior.

Purpose
The purpose of this strategy is to harness the power of data analytics to create a highly effective e-commerce platform for green businesses. By focusing on user behavior and key performance metrics, our goal is to significantly enhance user experience and increase conversion rates. This involves developing a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time insights into various aspects of the website's performance. Through continuous monitoring and analysis, the dashboard will help identify areas for improvement, optimize user interactions, and ensure the platform is tailored to meet the needs of eco-conscious consumers.
